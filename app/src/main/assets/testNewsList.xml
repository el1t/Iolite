<p>Most of the privacy concerns regarding FCPSonboard are related to the XpressConnect app. Here&#8217;s a few things you may want to know about this app:</p><ul><li>The app is used to download a certificate that authenticates your FCPS credentials and puts you on the correct wireless network. <b>Once you&#8217;ve installed the certificate, you no longer need the app and you can and delete it.</b></li><li>You have to reset your FCPS password every school year (this also resets your FCPS GAE password). You also have to renew the certificate every school year with your new credentials. Thus, after you reset your FCPS password each school year, you will also need to re-join FCPSonboard and re-download the XpressConnect app to reinstall the certificate. So you only need to have the app on your phone for a few minutes once every school year. Once the certificate is installed, you can delete XpressConnect.</li><li>This app is not downloaded on iOS devices-they have a different method of installing the certificate</li></ul><p>If you need help connecting your device to the WiFi, please see Ms. Tecuci in room 14.</p>

		<title>Reporting Service Learning Hours</title>
		<text>
			<![CDATA[
<p>Our school is now using a pilot program called x2VOL to track student service learning hours. This program will allow you to log your service hours online through Blackboard and Family Connection. X2VOL will enable you to keep track of your activities and hours as you perform them. You will need to sign on to Blackboard/Family Connection to create a profile and then you will be able to enter all your service learning activities as you go along and the program will total your hours for each year and provide a cumulative report at the end of your senior year. If you complete at least 40 hours by the time you graduate, you will receive a black cord to wear with your cap and gown. These two links provide instructions to set up your account and an overview of the program. If you have any questions, please contact Cathie Love at <a href="mailto:cmlove@fcps.edu">cmlove@fcps.edu</a>.</p><p>See <a href="https://www.tjhsst.edu/~2016jwoglom/uploads/x2VOL%20Guide%20for%20TJHSST%20Students.docx">the student guide</a> and <a href="https://www.tjhsst.edu/~2016jwoglom/uploads/x2VOL%20Student%20Login%20for%20TJHSST%20Expanded%20Version.ppt"> presentation</a>.</p>

		<title>Computational Linguistic Olympiad</title>
		<text>
			<![CDATA[
<p>Interested in computer science? World languages? Puzzles? If so, then the NACLO competition may just be for you. The North American Computational Linguistic Olympiad is a contest in which high-school students solve linguistic puzzles. In solving these puzzles, students learn about the diversity and consistency of language, while exercising logic skills. No prior knowledge of linguistics or second languages is necessary. Professionals in linguistics, computational linguistics and language technologies use dozens of languages to create engaging problems that represent cutting edge issues in their fields. The competition has attracted top students to study and work in those same fields. It is truly an opportunity for young people to experience a taste of natural-language processing in the 21st century. The first round contest will take place on January 29. Practices will be held on Fridays starting this week during B-block in T19. Sign up for NACLO practice to see what the fun is all about! (You can still participate if you can&#8217;t come to the practices, <a href="mailto:rgalanos@fcps.edu">email Miss Galanos (rgalanos@fcps.edu)</a> for details.</p>

The North American Computational Linguistic Olympiad is a contest in which high-school students solve linguistic puzzles. In solving these puzzles, students learn about the diversity and consistency of language, while exercising logic skills. No prior knowledge of linguistics or second languages is necessary. Professionals in linguistics, computational linguistics and language technologies use dozens of languages to create engaging problems that represent cutting edge issues in their fields. The competition has attracted top students to study and work in those same fields. It is truly an opportunity for young people to experience a taste of natural-language processing in the 21st century. The first round contest will take place on January 29. Practices will be held on Fridays starting this week during B-block in T19. Sign up for NACLO practice to see what the fun is all about! (You can still participate if you can&#8217;t come to the practices, email Miss Galanos (rgalanos@fcps.edu) for details.

L'Oreal would not be able to create the beauty products we all use and love - shampoos, mascara, lipsticks, and lotions - without our talented scientists and engineers, many of them women. L'Oreal is looking for young women who are interested in these fields. The National Girls Collaborative Project and L'Oreal USA invites high school girls in the Washington D.C. area to share why they love science using art, poetry, and/or multimedia. Twenty girls will then be selected to attend the L'Oreal USA For Women in Science Awards Ceremony in November where they will get to meet the 5 amazing female scientists being recognized at the ceremony. Share your love of STEM today! <a href="http://bit.ly/whydoyoulovescience">http://bit.ly/whydoyoulovescience</a>

		<title>Library Access during JLC</title>
		<text>
			<![CDATA[
<p>Students, we really need your help. We are trying to keep the library open for your use during JLC. However, it is very sad to report that a student&#8217;s rudeness to one of our valuable JLC parent volunteers means that we&#8217;ve lost another one of them. We cannot keep the main library and library computer classrooms open during JLC without the supervision provided by our parent volunteers, so we have special &#8220;quiet study&#8221; rules for JLC mornings that really must be adhered to by all of our students. Do your part to make the volunteers feel respected, valued and thanked for their service to you while librarians are at meetings on JLC Thursdays. Please print at home Wednesday nights in case you do not get access to the library&#8217;s spaces during JLC. -- Mrs. Carpenter</p>
