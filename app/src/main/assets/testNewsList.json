Â The most important thing that you should note is that you should not unplug mice or keyboards to use with your personal laptops when in labs. Â There has been theft of computer equipment and this should not occur at a place like TJ. Â Equipment shouldnâ€™t require constantly reconnecting unplugged or moved equipment and/or replacing missing mice and keyboards. Â Below is a list of computer lab etiquette that if followed will save our Tech Team hundreds of hours spent each school year that they spend replacing, repairing, and cleaning up after student messes. Â They could be spending this time updating computers and providing new innovative technology to students, but sadly much of it is spent doing lab maintenance and clean up. Â  Thanks for your attention to this.<br /></p>  <p class=\"MsoPlainText\"><b>Computer Lab Etiquette:</b></p><p></p>  <p class=\"MsoPlainText\"></p><ul><li>Do not unplug computer equipment.Â  If you accidentally unplug something, please plug it back in.<br /></li><li>Do not remove the mouse or keyboard from the computer.<br /></li><li>Do not leave trash behind.<br /></li><li>No eating or drinking.<br /></li><li>Report any computer problems to the teacher.<br /></li></ul><p></p>  <p class=\"MsoPlainText\"></p><p></p>  <p class=\"MsoPlainText\"></p><p></p>  <p class=\"MsoPlainText\"></p><p></p>  <p class=\"MsoPlainText\"></p><p></p>   ",
